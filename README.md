# Boat Anchor v2.1

## New in v2.1:

- Added ox_lib notification support.
- Re-wrote some parts of the code for easier changes.
- **MAYBE** Fixed an issue with the latest version of vMenu where the anchor would not work.

### Configuration file changes:
- Re-wrote the entire config file for easier understanding.
- Added "NotificationType" to easily change from the normal GTA notifications to ox_lib.
